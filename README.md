# react-todo-django
I develop full-stack project by using backend by python programming with Django framework.
The frontend is developed by React.js. 
database use is here is SQL llite.
I use "bootstrap": "^5.2.3",
I built a To-Do application using Django and React. 
I achieved this with the djangorestframework, django-cors-headers, axios, bootstrap, and reactstrap libraries.
